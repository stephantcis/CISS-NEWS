    <p style="width: 600px;">We are happy to be here with you all celebrating this day, my name is Anna Filippa I am the student council president, my name is Stephan I am the vice president, & my name is Emanuel I am the PYP leader. We are representing the student council. As an international school, it is essential that we are united to celebrate and learn about the host countries' cultures and traditions. 
        <br><br>       
        Today we celebrate Norway's National Day, and it is a day where we can remember that we have many opportunities and rights. We have the opportunity to learn, to speak our minds, to make a difference, and to live our lives in our own way. But we must not forget that these rights and opportunities came at a cost. Many people fought and died for our freedom and independence.
        <br><br>
        So today, as we celebrate our nation and freedom, we must remember what is important in life - to live in freedom, respect, and justice. We must honor those who fought for our rights and opportunities, and continue to fight for a more equal and fair world.
        <br><br>
        So today, as we celebrate Norway's national day, we want to remind ourselves of the value of diversity and how it has shaped our school and our lives. We can celebrate Norway’s culture while learning about and appreciating other cultures. We can be proud of our nation while respecting and valuing other nations.
        <br><br>
        As representatives of the student council, we want to thank you amazing students for making this school what it is - a truly international school. We have students from all parts of the world, with different backgrounds, languages, and cultures, yet we have a shared appreciation for diversity and respect for each other.           
        <br><br>
        We want to thank all the teachers and staff at our school for creating an inclusive and respectful learning environment for all of us. We also want to thank our parents and community for allowing us to attend this great school and be part of this international community.
        <br><br>
        Happy National Day, everyone! Let's continue to celebrate diversity and create a world where everyone can feel welcome and valued. On behalf of the student council, we wish you a wonderful day. Thank you.
